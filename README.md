# Amazon_Product_Review
Introduction->Now days Customers' reviews have become the most important thing in Business World. This data 
contains lots of useful information that can be used to take efficient Business
decisions. Hence it is necessary to store and process such data to extract knowledge 
from it and by using that take efficient decisions. Machine learning is the set of different 
methods that can be used to find patterns from the dataset and then use those 
patterns to predict future conditions or to make efficient decisions under some 
conditions.Machine learning can make decisions independently at its own. Machine 
learning is categorized into two types.SuperVised Machine Learning and Unsupervised_Machine_Learning.
Requirement Analysis ->
Logical Dataset:
Experiments are performed on dataset which is collected from Kaggle Repository. The dataset contains the data of Products of amazon and customer reviews and ratings.
Approach----->
In this dataset i have used Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm to categorized the reviews as positive,negative and neutral reviews which is asked to do in the assignment.I have used K-Means to make the clusters.According to the clusters i have plotted the result.With Supeervised Machine learning algorithm i have predicted the rating according to the customer reviews.Here,I have used Logistic regression as Supervised Algorithm.
